The slides are [here](/presentations/sol2/C++ Now/2018/2018.03.28 - ThePhD - Compile Fast, Run Faster, Scale Forever), which in and of themselves I think turned out very nicely.

I gave 2 additional talks at C++ Now too: 2 lightning talks. One was about [`std::embed`](https://github.com/ThePhD/embed), a way to lift a resource into a compile-time view. The other was a less technical and more personal talk about "Where I Belong", and how I feel like I belong in a given place.

There are a lot of criteria people have for feeling like they belong. It usually boils down to feeling like there's a community that you can tap into and share with and encourage.
