# Supporting the Projects

A lot of my work is done out in the open, generally made open-source and freely available. If you like any of the projects in my [portfolio](/portfolio) -- in particular my open-source projects for Lua, Unicode, C++ Standardization, and more -- feel free to use any of the means below to support the projects.

For business inquiries whose revenue can help support the projects, send it to Shepherd's Oasis through [shepherd@soasis.org](mailto:shepherd@soasis.org)!
