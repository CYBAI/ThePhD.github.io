I have spent too many hours gathering field experience, surveying opinions, implementing those opinions, evaluating the semantics and noting down feedback to keep this to myself. I am frequently pinged or e-mailed by people asking me what happened to references in not just `optional`, but `variant`, `expected`, and other return type and parameter types in the standard library.

Most frustrating of all is the amount of utterly imaginative formulation about not only the problem space, but the solution space. In this post, you will find the culmination of serious inquiry and dedicated effort into what is both the theoretical soundness but also usability
