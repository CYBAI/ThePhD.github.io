Working Group 21 (The C++ Committee of the ISO) has approved and encouraged Study Group 16 ! Please lend your voice and ideas for improving C++ support for Unicode and text processing by joining me and others in:

- The Mailing list: http://www.open-std.org/mailman/listinfo/unicode
- The C++ Slack: https://cpplang.slack.com/messages/sg16-unicode
- The GitHub: https://github.com/sg16-unicode

It's time to get Unicode into C++, and to do it right with SG-16. I'm very excited about this, and have already presented my [earlier unicode abstraction to the group](/presentations/unicode/2018.03.07 - ThePhD - a rudimentary unicode abstraction.pdf). I've begun to work on understanding what a useful `Encoding` concept for C++ would look like, and how we can use it to further advance operations like Transcoding, Normalization, Segmentation and other necessary unicode algorithms.

If you have ideas and thoughts, please do bring them to the Github Organization / Repositories and to the mailing list! We have a decent core membership but it is always great to hear what the use cases of others are.
