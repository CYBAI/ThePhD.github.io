It is finally time.<!--more-->

After 3 months and quite a bit of hard work, I have finally finished the Google Summer of Code program. In it, I have finished an enhanced and improved implementation of [P0237](https://wg21.link/p0237) and [N2050](https://wg21.link/n2050). In my original proposal, I stated that I would implement a range-based `bit_view`, a container adaptor version of `dynamic_bitset`, all of the `bit_iterator`/`bit_reference`/`bit_value` types, and more. Going through the checklist of each phase:


# Phase 1 - bit_iterator, bit_reference, bit_value and bit_view

‚úîÔ∏è üèÜ üéâ - Absolutely covered, with all stretch goals and even MORE met!

This was spoken about [much, much earlier](/std-byte-me-gsoc-2019). We had both `dynamic_bitset<C>` and `bit_view<R>` covered.


# Phase 2 - Iterator Improvements and Algorithms

‚úîÔ∏è üèÜ - Everything, plus most of the stretch goals.

This was covered by 2 previous articles, [here](/proxies-references-gsoc-2019) and [here](/container-adaptors-gsoc-2019). I won't recap absolutely everything, but it was a bit of a struggle getting most of the iterator constraints perfectly okay.

We also added some serious utilities here that cover some of the use cases first brought up after completion of the first phase. [Jonathan M√ºller mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/c6699n/stdbyte_me_bit_handling_in_a_future_standard/es6vuu0/) that he had some use cases for directly working with a potentially disjoint set of bits. [The `tiny/bit_view`](https://github.com/foonathan/tiny/blob/master/test/bit_view.cpp) class in his library does that. I added support for creating a view of a set of bits that could target precisely bits `[x, y)` by using the `Extents` class portion of the new `bit_view<Range, Extents>`:

```cpp
// 0xFBFF = (MSB) 0b‚Ä≠1111101111111111‚Ä¨ (LSB)
std::vector<std::uint32_t> storage{ 0x0000FBFF, 0xFFFFFFFF };
bitsy::bit_view<R, bitsy::static_bit_extents<10, 22>> truncated_view_bits(
	storage.data(), storage.size());
assert(truncated_view_bits.size() == 12);
// 0th bit of biew is 10th bit,
// 10th bit of 0xFBFF is false
assert(truncated_view_bits[0] == bitsy::bit0);
```

I believe taking a class is far more flexible than `span`'s single-numeric-value `extent` type. It also allows for taking a `bitsy::dynamic_bit_extents` type as well, whose size can be calculated entirely at runtime. This was a severe improvement to the API that resulted in covering a much broader selection of use cases while still retaining the same abstraction powers.

Writing the algorithms was simple, really. But the next part is where things got.... interesting.


# Phase 3 - Optimizations

‚úîÔ∏è üèÜ - Everything, plus most of the stretch goals.

Optimizing everything was the hardest part of this Summer of Code, but also the most satisfying. I plan to write an article later with much more detailed information, but the success here is clear as day. There were severe improvements made to the base intrinsics GCC ships contained in libstdc++, since they only work with unsigned types and generally trip over themselves with enumerations. We also identified several places where GCC trips over itself as far as code generation, something that actually made me publish this article today rather than a full week ago (feel free to poke the bear here and see all the zany codegen and constexpr mishaps between MSVC, GCC, and Clang: ). I would like to actually congratulate Clang, which gets the code generation and work done 100% right when you affix the platform:

In all seriousness, I could spend all day writing about this kind of stuff. But, why should I prattle on about algorithmic improvements, intrinsic usage, codegen and the like, when I can simply show some numbers. I re-implemented [Howard Hinnant's performance benchmarks](https://howardhinnant.github.io/onvectorbool.html) for almost all of the algorithms he talked about (sans `std::rotate`). The results are in:

There is still performance left on the table here in some cases, but the results are clear: our `bitsy::bit_iterator`s and data structures severely outperform `std::vector<bool>` from current-generation libstdc++ (GCC 9) and either meet or exceed the current algorithmic benchmarks in all categories.

I'm almost certain Alisdair Meredith and Vincent Reverdy would be proud to know that the papers they thought up of wrote over a decade ago, respectively, can enable such great performance. And the best part about this is...


# You Can Have It Too

While I implemented this for libstdc++ and for [itsy/bitsy](https://github.com/ThePhD/itsy_bitsy), the performance is not limited to the standard, or to itsy bitsy. The point is that the iterators are not an implementation-defined, private mess. Nor is it like `std::bitset`, where it has no iterators or `begin()`/`end()` at all. These are well-defined, public interfaces that are going to go into the standard. That means if you write a data structure that works with bits and opt to use `bitsy::bit_iterator` or `__gnu_cxx::bit_iterator`, you get the performance benefits when using `std::equal` and `std::find` and `std::copy` too. So rather than sinking the tiny handful of standard library maintainer time into optimizing a single container, they optimize the algorithm and every gets to benefit.

This also has further downstream consequences: as [pretty as Conor Hoekstra's code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48gV1SNm3WA) is, nobody who cares in performance critical areas is going to use that beautiful solution if it exhibits the `std::vector<bool>` levels of performance. Performance _is_ correctness, and if I can write a disgusting hand-optimized loop and get better performance, you had better believe I'm going to write that disgusting code that would probably make Conor barf.

**But!**

The liberating point about this exploration here is that we can have our beautiful algorithmic cake and develop a powerful algorithmic intuition, and as long as we commit to improving the _algorithm_, we can have our speedy cake too and share it with _everyone_. That means that you, the application developer, can focus on algorithm intuition and reaching Sean Parent levels of "that's a rotate". And the library developers and interested parties can write the optimization in their algorithms and other places. Once. For everyone. For all time. And finally move on to doing more interesting things that twiddling bits, something that should've been a solved problem for 20 years...!

But I digress. There is a lot more to do, but this is it for now.

Remember to optimize your algorithms, not your data structures, and hug your local library developer (with permission).

Catch you later. üíö

P.S.: double underscores are ugly and I hate them with every fiber of my being.
