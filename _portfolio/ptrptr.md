The `ptrptr` project was started to measure the performance of a common C++ abstraction used from the smallest startups to the biggest million-line codebases all across the world for `std::unique_ptr`. Along the way, the design was modified to work with `std::shared_ptr` and `boost::shared_ptr`, allowing individuals to leverage this simple and abstraction to develop cleaner, safer APIs.

Learning how to use python to great effectiveness for visualization allowed me an easy way to understand the data being measured, and also taught me a lot about how you present data to others.
