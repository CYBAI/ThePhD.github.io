There does not exist a good, flexible, backwards-compatible solution for Text in C++. Choosing a library either requires taking the entire thing (Qt), getting involved in a very complex interface (ICU), dealing with sometimes limiting API choices (CopperSpice), or having a well-done but very opinionated design set (the proposed Boost.Text).

Where is the standard library-friendly, maximum performance solution for handling text encoding and decoding in C++ and C?

This project is the push to reach that goal.




# Current Funding

The project has the goal of being fully funded by mid 2020 so that all users can have a high quality solution of text that is not kept within one company or ecosystem, but ported to the Standard Library for use by everyone. Work hours are laid out [in this proposal here](https://github.com/ThePhD/text/blob/develop/docs/funding/2019.09.21%20-%20Towards%20Text%20in%20the%20Standard%20Library%20-%20ThePhD.pdf).

Funding goes toward:

- Funding development;
- Targeting specific features;
- Covering general library support;
- Covering specific company or vendor support;
- and, Attending WG14 (C Committee) and WG21 (C++ Committee) meetings.


Specialized solutions for C++11 (or C++03) can be made. If you, your company or organization is interested in helping or need special features/early access to features listed below, please [contact me](phdofthehouse@gmail.com).



## Funding Goals and Progress

Below are the published funding goals. Sponsors may pay into specific goals or, if given a large enough donation, create a new goal entirely; otherwise, funding falls into the categories in a top-to-bottom, linear fashion. Goals marked (_Stretch_) are not quite bare-minimum necessary, but would be absolutely wonderful to accomplish!

- Bootstrap Initial Development, to get library tested and released;
- Reach Full-Time Text Development to reach 2020 Goal;
- Cover C Standard Library development to reach maximum amount of users with basic functionality;

_Current Goal: Bootstrap Initial Development_

Current Goal Total: $1,248.87 USD / $24,000.00 USD

# Technical Details

The work is ongoing in these repositories here:

- [C++](https://github.com/ThePhD/text);
- and, [C](https://github.com/ThePhD/cuneicode).

The C++ library submodules and builds on top of the C one for fast-path functions. Internally, the C library is implemented with C++ and -- hopefully soon in the future -- vectorization by hand or with [SIMD/`std::experimental::simd`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/simd/simd). The principals and inner workings of the implementation are detailed in a series of talks, slides and posts:

The current spread of goals is as follows.


### ‚Ö†: Core Text Utilities [ 5% ] 

- Encoding objects for one-by-one encoding and decoding.
  - `utf8`, `utf16`, `utf32`, `narrow_execution` and `wide_execution` Encoding Object types;
  - and, `basic_utf8<char_type>`, `basic_utf16<char_type>`, and `basic_utf32<char_type>` types.
- `decode(...)`, `encode(...)`, and `transcode(...)` functions.
- `decode_view<encoding, ...>`, `encode_view<encoding, ...>`, and `transcode_view<encoding, ...>` range types.

[ ‚£ø‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä ]


### ‚Ö°: Normalization Forms [ 0% ]

- All four Unicode Normalization Forms, as specified in [UAX #15](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/).
  - Canonical Form `nfc`
  - Canonical Form `nfd`
  - Compatibility Form `nfkc`
  - Compatibility Form `nfkd`
- `text_view<Encoding, NormalizationForm, Container>`
- `text<Encoding, NormalizationForm, Container>`

- Cover INCITS/ANSI fees.
- Take functionality through all of WG14, put into C Libraries such as:
  - `musl`.
  - `glibc`.
  - Potentially: new LLVM `libc`.

[ ‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä ]

- The WHATWG (https://whatwg.org/) specifies many encodings which are required to support the web.
- Covers developing encodings to handle [encodings covered by the WHATWG Living Standard](https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/).

[ ‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä ]
